# Youtube-Summarizer

A YouTube summarizer is a tool that condenses videos into key points. Here's how it works:

1. You provide the link to a YouTube video.
2. The summarizer downloads the video.
3. It separates the audio track from the video.
4. The audio is converted into text (speech recognition).
5. The text undergoes cleaning to remove stop words and punctuations.
6. Sentences are identified and broken down into words.
7. The summarizer analyzes the text to find the most important parts.
8. Using these key points, it generates a concise summary.
9. This summary highlights the main ideas of the original video.
10. You can quickly grasp the video's content without watching the whole thing.
